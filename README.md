This code is quite sloppy looking but is the full working code for an algorithmn that tracks pricing of put options given a watchlist
and determines the most profitable contracts to sell while keeping risk at a minimum.
The result is output in the stonks.csv file and a visual of this can be seen on fleesanalytics.com

It can also read quotes outloud, and recently is able to produce it's own charts with a visual of the projected stock price
based on the current options' trading prices.
